# DAY 3
## PART 1
Sum up the masked values of each bit, if it is greater than half the amount of samples, then it is most common, otherwise it is not. Arrange most common and least common bits into 2 numbers and multiply them.
## PART 2
Copy the given input into 2 arrays and eliminate the values that do not match the most common or least common bits for each bit from most significant to least. Multiply the last numbers standing together.
